title: Setup

> Before you begin, you need to have completed the [CMSSW pre-exercise](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop2021-lesson-cmssw/).
>
> If you experience problems with clipboard sharing between your host machine and your VM or Docker container, the [text dump file](../files/lessonDump.txt) of the lesson might be of help. You can download this file directly in your VM or Docker container using, e.g., the `wget` command, and follow along to copy the necessary commands directly from the text file.
